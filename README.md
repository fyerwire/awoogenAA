# Awoogen
This mod adds in canines to your regular clangen experience!
This is a standalone mod and it does not have a lite or sprite pack version. This means it is not compatible with most other clangen mods, unless those mods state otherwise. Not compatible with lifegen.


The aim is to keep up to date with clangen dev version while adding new features. For this reason, some updates may take a while!


## Requirements
Currently requires 2GB of RAM to run, may require more in the future.


## Downloads
We are currently on Moonlight (1.1)
[Moonlight Download](https://github.com/Koriiy/awoogen/releases/tag/v1.1-moonlight)
Grab the version for your operating system and run like regular clangen!


## Themes
Themes are available for this game! To use, select one theme in your settings, then close and reload the game.


## Running from Source Code
Awoogen now requires the use of Poetry for dependencies!

If you have already configured your setup to run from source for Clangen or any other Clangen mod, you do not need any extra steps for Awoogen.

Otherwise, follow the instructions on Clangen's github page.

Note that I don't provide support for running from source now that builds are available!

## Crashes and Bugs
Reminder that Awoogen comes with all of the bugs of Clangen dev, along with many of my own creation. If you care about your saves, back them up occasionally!

First time running Awoogen from source and encounter a crash? Please do not report this. Check your IDE or terminal  for information about the crash. If it says out of memory, you do not meet the minimum RAM requirements to run, try closing other programs and running again. If it says anything else, you likely did not configure poetry correctly.

Have you run Awoogen successfully at least once? Report the crash to me on Discord! Remember to include the full error so I can figure out what's happening. You can either DM me or ping me in the thread on Discord. Or you can try reporting on Github but I am new to the platform haha. Either way, thanks in advance!

Other bugs? Please report them as well.
